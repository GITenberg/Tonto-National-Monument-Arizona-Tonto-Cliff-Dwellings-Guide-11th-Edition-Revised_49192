<p class="tb">Although Tonto National Monument was established in
1907 it received little protection until 1930. Considerable
vandalism and thoughtless destruction of much of the prehistoric
material took place in the 1920s.</p>
<p>In recent years some prehistoric Indian ruins have had to
be closed to visitors to preserve these fragile structures.
Please help us keep the Lower Ruin open for many years to
come: restrain children from climbing and running in the
dwelling, and keep off the walls.</p>

features of interest. Corresponding numbered paragraphs

</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small"><span class="large">TONTO TRAIL</span></span></h2>
<p>Brutal heat in summer, hard frosts in winter, strong
shrivelling winds of spring, and always erratic rainfall combine
here to make a desert, a place of extremes. The world&rsquo;s
arid lands are of many kinds; here is the Upper Sonoran
Desert, with its giant cactus and remarkably varied plant
life. Here are found many creatures which have adapted in
behavior or body features to arid conditions. Man too has
evolved in the desert in many ways, over at least ten thousand
years, from roving bands of primitive hunters to the
massive urban developments of today.</p>
<p>Nearly seven hundred years ago farming Indians now
called the Salado (sa-LAH-doe) fitted their lives to this
desert. They lived in cool, thick-walled apartment-like villages,
grew irrigated crops of corn, squash, beans, cotton and
amaranth (pigweed), made handsome pottery and wove elaborate
cotton textiles. Though capable farmers, the Salado
were also hunters and gatherers, well aware of the uses
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
to be made of the desert&rsquo;s wild resources.</p>
<p>As you walk the winding half-mile trail to the Lower
Ruin you will see many desert plants used by the Salado so
long ago, some of the birds, and perhaps other wild creatures
of the desert which are active during the day.</p>
<p>Take time to breathe the fragrant dry air of the desert,
look about you, enjoy just being, listen to the silence. Don&rsquo;t
feel bound to reading this little book; this is simply a guide
to some of what you will see. We hope that you will see&mdash;and
feel&mdash;much more.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">1</span> <b>BABY SAGUARO.</b> This little white-spined cactus,
an infant less than ten years old now, will grow up in a
hundred years or so to look like the towering giants scattered
over these hills. Young saguaros (sah-WAR-ohs) are
delicate and need a &ldquo;nurse tree&rdquo; like this mesquite to shelter
them from the sun.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">2</span> <b>HEDGEHOG CACTUS.</b> The first cactus to bloom each
spring; the large magenta blossoms of this many-headed
plant must have been a welcome sight to the Salado, for
they signalled relief to come from the monotonous winter
diet of dried foods.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">3</span> <b>BARREL CACTUS.</b> Though the barrel cactus is
fabled as a source of emergency water in the desert, it is not
at all reliable. The amount of unpleasant-tasting liquid in it
varies with the amount and recency of rainfall.</p>
<p>Not much use was made of the barrel cactus; its fruit is
unpalatable, but several finger rings made of its hooked red
spines were found in the cliff dwelling. Recent desert Indians
sometimes made cooking pots of the barrel: they cut
off its top and removed some of the pulp from the stump,
then put food in the cavity and dropped in hot stones to
cook it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">4</span> <b>TESAJO</b> (tess-AH-hoe). Tiny edible tomato-red fruits,
ready in November and December, give this little member of
the cholla (CHOY-ya) cactus group its other name: Christmas
cactus.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">5</span> <b>YUCCA</b> (YUH-ca). This very useful plant provides
many things. Leaf fibers make strong thread for mats, string,
rope, sandals, nets and snares; the buds, flowers, fruit, stalks
and seeds are edible. The root contains saponin, useful as a
medicine or as soap or an excellent shampoo. Sharp leaf
tips make good awls.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Mesquite leaves and beans</i></p>
</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">6</span> <b>MESQUITE.</b> Pods and beans of
the mesquite (mes-KEET), nutritious
and sweet, are still an important
part of the desert Indian&rsquo;s diet.
Pods are ground into flour and
pressed to make little loaves of
staple bread. Fermented, the same
flour makes an intoxicating drink.
The sweet sap of the tree can be
used to make candy, black dye,
or even glue for broken pottery.</p>
<p>Mesquite has invaded vast areas
during the past century, areas
once desert grasslands. Cattle,
grazing this land since the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
1870s, have eaten away the grasses, encouraging growth
of woody species like mesquite. The sweet mesquite pods
are a favorite cattle food, and the beans pass unharmed
through the digestive tract to be deposited far and wide.
A natural cycle of drought and erosion coupled with heavy
grazing has destroyed much of the desert grassland and converted
it to mesquite. With loss of the grasses, erosion has
accelerated, springs have dried up, and formerly sandy and
smooth canyon floors (once suitable for small-scale farming)
have eroded to boulder-strewn wastes. In less than a century
we have made drastic changes in the desert, changes whose
consequences we are only beginning to see.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">7</span> <b>SOTOL.</b> Mats, sandals,
coarse ropes and other household
items can be made of the
fibers in the narrow leaves of
this plant. Young flower stalks
of sotol (SO-tall) are edible
when roasted; many deep
stone-lined roasting pits are
found throughout this area.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/pmg007.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="515" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Sotol leaf and fruiting stem.</i></p>
</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">8</span> <b>LICHENS</b> (LIE-kens).
The green and orange blotches
resembling paint on this
boulder are lichens, plants consisting
of an alga and a fungus living together. As the plants
grow, their secretions begin dissolving solid rock into fragments,
the first step in the long natural process of soil formation.
It has been estimated that in the desert it takes
1,000 years to develop one inch of topsoil.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">9</span> <b>OCOTILLO</b> (oh-ko-TEE-yo). This thorny member of
the candlewood family (NOT a cactus!) has handsome
orange-red flowers at the ends of each branch in spring.
Orioles<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>, hummingbirds and bumblebees love ocotillo nectar.
Like the palo verde, the ocotillo drops its leaves to conserve
moisture while its green bark carries on a minimum of
food manufacture. Within a few days of a good rain it
sprouts a whole new set of leaves, only to shed them again
as soon as the soil dries. The plant may develop and shed a
half dozen sets of leaves in a single growing season.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">10</span> <b>SAGUARO SKELETON.</b> The Salado built roofs and
fashioned tools from the wooden ribs of saguaro skeletons,
such as those in various states of decomposition up the
draw above you. Skeletons also supplied wood for household
fires in an area with few other fuel sources.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">11</span> <b>CANE CHOLLA.</b> Flower buds of many types of
cholla are edible; Pima Indians, modern desert farmers living
near Phoenix, steam them as vegetables. The curve-bill
thrasher builds its untidy nest in this cholla.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">12</span> <b>JOJOBA</b> (ho-HO-ba). Moisture is retained in these
large leaves by a thick wax coating. The jojoba&rsquo;s large oily
nuts, slightly resembling a
peanut in size and shape,
can be eaten raw or
parched; early settlers used
them as a coffee substitute,
giving the shrub the name
&ldquo;coffeeberry.&rdquo; The plant is
an important browse for
white-tail and mule deer.</p>

<p><span class="cnwhite">13</span> <b>SAGUARO.</b> These magnificent giants are indicator
plants of the Sonoran
Desert. Saguaros produce a beautiful white blossom which
has been designated the Arizona State Flower. Its bright
red fruit is edible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Saguaros grow as high as 50 feet and more, and may live
as long as 200 years. After a good rain, large saguaros may
weigh several tons. Their roots are shallow&mdash;not more than
three feet deep&mdash;which allows rapid absorption of ground-surface
moisture. The pleated skin expands, accordion-like,
as the inner pulp swells with absorbed water.</p>
<p>The Gila woodpecker is responsible for many of the holes
you see riddling mature saguaros; the bird will excavate a
half-dozen or more potential nests every year. Other birds
use the woodpecker holes, particularly the elf owl, a six-inch
midget which can live only where the saguaro and the woodpecker
provide it with a home.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The Annex.</i></p>
</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">14</span> <b>THE ANNEX.</b> Look above you, at the base of the
cliff; do you see a five-foot manmade wall? Once there was
a Salado village in the shallow recess above; it was contemporary
with the Lower Ruin just around the corner and
probably housed its population overflow. There were about
a dozen rooms in the Annex, traceable from tiny fragments
of walls and plaster room outlines. Because the
recess is so shallow and offers little shelter, the Annex was
destroyed by weather long ago. What you see from the trail
here is all there is to see.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">15</span> <b>TEDDYBEAR CHOLLA.</b> Imagine the misery this
cactus gave the scantily-clad Salados as they moved about
gathering wild food and hunting deer and other creatures.
The teddybear&rsquo;s joints break off very easily and stick to a
victim at the slightest contact, even seeming to jump at a
victim, hence its other name, &ldquo;jumping cactus.&rdquo; Cholla
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
spines penetrate deeply and are very painful to remove;
remember&mdash;people who stay on the trail stay out of the way
of the cholla. The noisy cactus wren somehow makes use of
the teddybear as a nesting site, and the woodrat drags
cholla joints home with which to barricade his burrow.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">16</span> <b>CEMENTED ROCK.</b> This rock broke away from the
cliff above and rolled here.
The diagram explains the geology;
broken, faulted Dripping
Spring Formation rocks, here
mostly quartzites, were overlain
by a layer of limestone;
water percolating through the
limestone dissolved materials
which then seeped down
through the fragmented rocks
and, drying, cemented the
broken bits together, as in the
boulder here.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Overhanging roof of natural cave preserved the ruin.</i></p>
</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">17</span> <b>FORMATION OF THE CAVE.</b> Under the shattered
quartzite was a layer of soft mudstone. Rain and seepage
dissolved the mudstone, removing support below the
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
quartzite, which then fell away from the cliff. Gradually
this natural erosion enlarged the cave you see today. When
the Salado came seeking a protected place to live they found
a natural cave some 50 feet deep, 40 feet high, and 85 feet
long, littered with all the building stone they needed.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">18</span> <b>BASEMENT ROOMS.</b> Outside and below the cave
were 3 or 4 &ldquo;basement&rdquo; rooms, probably houses identical
to those in the cave and the Annex. The cave village itself
contained about 20 rooms originally, the exact number
uncertain because rooms toward the front of the dwelling
have weathered away. With the Annex, basement rooms and
cave village counted together, there were about 40 rooms
(houses) in this immediate area. While population estimates
are difficult to make with accuracy, probably between 40
and 60 people lived here long ago.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="pcap"><i>Fragmentary walls of the &ldquo;basement&rdquo; rooms.</i></p>
</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">19</span> <b>THE ORIGINAL ENTRY.</b> Above you is a V-shaped
notch which was probably the only original entrance to the
village. A ladder from the roof of a basement room led to
the passage above, where projecting rocks are polished from
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
long use as handholds and footrests. When the Indians
wanted to close the village door, they simply pulled up the
ladder.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/pmg013.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="540" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The notch which was the original entry.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Salado children who scrambled in and out of this
entryway knew the dangers of these loose rocky slopes,
but our children are much less aware of the slope&rsquo;s
hazards. For your children&rsquo;s safety, please keep them
with you. Leaving the trail or running on it invites
injury.</p>
<p>As you go up the modern stairs, note the retaining wall;
it is probably closely similar to the original wall. The village
once extended out as far as the retaining wall, rooms
dividing what is now open space at the front of the cave,
but the original rooms and wall have eroded away.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">20</span> <b>THE ANCIENT SCENE.</b> Think back 700 years and
imagine this view then; no power lines, no roads, no lake, no
smog. This spectacular view of the Salt River Valley provided
a fine defensive outlook. We do not know who&mdash;or
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
what&mdash;drove the Salado to the high places, but this village
and others like it seem to have been built for defense. Little
evidence of warfare has been found.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/pmg014.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="540" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Once four or five rooms were here in the front of the cave; erosion has destroyed all but the wall stubs you see on the right.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Because the ruin is easily visible from the valley it was
quickly discovered, probably by ranchers in the 1870s. The
first written record of the Tonto ruins appeared in 1883,
by which time they were well known.</p>
<p>The cliff dwelling overlooks the valley where Salado
farms were tilled&mdash;1,000 feet below the village here, and
2 to 5 miles away. Ancient irrigation canals which watered
Salado corn could still be seen until Roosevelt Lake flooded
the valley after 1911. To walk 5 miles or more to tend a
crop was not unusual for a Pueblo farmer. Well into this
century Hopi Indians, distant modern relatives of the
ancient Salado, ran as far as 20 miles to their cornfields.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">21</span> <b>TWO-STORY ROOM.</b> The west wall of this two-story
room is one of the few that reached to the cave
ceiling. The 3 beams mark the ceiling of the room&rsquo;s first
floor, and 2 beam sockets higher up indicate the second
floor ceiling. Most rooms had a 3-foot-high parapet wall
around the roof, providing a safe place in the open air for
work or play.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The small hole in the second floor wall overlooks the original
entryway, reminding us that this was probably a
fortified village built during troubled times.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">

<p class="pcap"><i>Two-story room (note sealed doorway in first floor)</i></p>
</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">22</span> <b>THE ENTRY HALL.</b> If
you stood here long ago,
you might see a man bringing
home harvested corn, or
game of some sort. Women
might be lugging heavy water
jars up from the spring
in the canyon. Small children
would play about your
feet while their older sisters
and brothers solemnly imitated
adult work.</p>
<p>The little unroofed room to your right is a fine example
of the way the Salado used the natural cave: here they
simply built a curved wall across a natural recess, creating a
small unroofed room which was apparently used for cooking,
judging from the smoke-blackened walls and the several
firepits once found here.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Room with half-<b>T</b> door.</i></p>
</div>
<p>These people made many of their doorways in the half-<b>T</b>
shape you see in this little room. The half-<b>T</b> prevented
strong drafts, and provided
a place to balance with one
hand while stooping through
the door. Salado men
averaged about 5 feet 6 inches
tall, the women about 5 feet,
so they had as much difficulty
as we do getting
through these small doorways.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">23</span> <b>PARTIAL ROOF.</b> This
large room contains a good
example of Salado roofing
technique. Walls of stone and
mud were built in courses
about 2 feet high each, until
they reached 6 feet in height. A central upright post was
then placed to hold a main roof beam. The smaller roof
poles rested on the main beam, and above them went a layer
of reeds, saguaro ribs, grass or other small poles. On top of
these layers went a thick mud coat, deep enough to allow a
shallow firepit to be safely built in the upstairs floor.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">24</span> <b>HALLWAY.</b> The village was not built all at once.
Construction at different times is revealed in sealed doorways,
wall abutments, and hallways. This passageway gave
access to three rows of ground floor rooms; it probably
also served as additional storage space.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Stone-lined hatchway.</i></p>
</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">25</span> <b>ORIGINAL ROOM.</b> Look inside and imagine how
dark and stuffy these rooms were. Often ground-floor rooms
in the back of the cave&mdash;dark and poorly ventilated&mdash;were
used just for storage. Ladders gave access to different floor
levels in the village, sometimes through corner hatchways
like the one in this room.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">26</span> <b>ROOM USES.</b> During excavation of this village, an
infant burial was found in the corner of this room. The
death rate among infants was high, and burying babies in
the corners of houses was the custom among Pueblo Indians
until quite recent times. Adults were usually buried in the
loose rock slope in front of the village or in abandoned
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
rooms. Terraces in front of some cliff dwellings served as
burial grounds, but no terrace or cemetery has been found
here.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">

<p class="pcap"><i>Connecting rooms in two-story section of ruin; burial was found in right-hand corner of farthest room.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Although these rooms are small by our standards, there
was no need among the Salado for larger spaces; actually
the Salado houses are remarkably large in comparison to
most cliff dwellings. Since the climate is mild here, most of
the Indians&rsquo; time was spent on the roofs and outdoors.
Houses served mainly for sleeping, storage, cooking, and
winter shelter. Salado furniture was minimal: a few pottery
vessels, baskets, spare tools, a metate and firepit, mats for
sleeping and sitting, perhaps a ladder to an upstairs room.
Looms for weaving their elaborate cotton textiles were
apparently outdoors, as no trace of them was found in the
rooms.</p>

<p><span class="cnwhite">27</span> <b>ORIGINAL CLAY
FLOOR.</b> All floors in the
village were once smooth,
made of adobe clay like
this one, but heavy traffic
over recent years has destroyed
all but this one
remnant. Please help us preserve this floor by staying out of
the room.</p>

</div>
<p>At the back of the room the clay floor joins natural bedrock
of the cave. Because the cave floor was so irregular, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Indians had to build retaining walls and fill to make a level
spot for their homes. Wet clay was spread on the fill to
make, when dry, a smooth, level floor.</p>
<p>Note the little clay-lined firepit in the center of the room;
it is only about 6 inches deep and 5 across, but provided
adequate heat and cooking space.</p>
<p><span class="cnwhite">28</span> <b>METATE</b> (meh-TAH-tay) and <b>MANO</b> (MAH-no).
These Spanish words refer to the stone tools used for grinding
dried corn, seeds, mesquite pods, palo verde beans and
other foodstuffs. The small, hand-held stone is the mano.
We do not know what the Salado called these essential
kitchen tools, for their lost language was unwritten.</p>
<p>Imagine the many hours of hard work represented by the
deep grooves worn in this hard stone! Try it yourself: kneel
and rub the mano back and forth over the trough of the
metate; think of doing such work for many hours each
day.</p>

<p><span class="cnwhite">29</span> <b>SMOKE-BLACKENED WALL.</b> Just as we do spring
cleaning, Salado women frequently replastered their little
houses with clay. Smoke from cooking and heating fires
blackened the wall, but you can still see here hundreds of
finger marks left as wet clay was smoothed by hand on the
wall.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="cnwhite">30</span> <b>OPEN ROOM.</b> The Indians did not build a roof for
this room, because the cave ceiling served the same purpose.
Since this large room had good light and ventilation, and
offered space protected from the fierce summer sun, it was
probably used as a community work area. Two seed
grinders, called mortars, are worn into the bench-like
bedrock in the back.</p>

<p>Any of the larger rooms in this village could have
been used as meeting rooms or ceremonial chambers, but
after damage by early souvenir hunters, no evidence of such
use could be found during scientific excavation of the village.
Another ruin in the area had a large rectangular room
with an altar and other features indicating ceremonial use.
Pueblo Indian religion today is deeply threaded through all
phases of daily life, and these ancient Pueblos were undoubtedly
equally religious.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><br /><span class="small">THE SALADO STORY</span></h2>
<p>A thousand years ago the Salado first arrived in this basin, coming here
around A.D. 900 from the region north of the Little Colorado River drainage.
Though we do not know what they called themselves, it is here where later they
were given their modern name. In Spanish, Salado means salty, referring to the
Salt River near which these Indians lived.</p>
<p>When the Salado first entered the Roosevelt Basin they lived in the lowlands,
along the Salt River floodplain where they could easily irrigate their fields.
Though the area may seem inhospitable, the river&rsquo;s flow is reliable&mdash;and water
is an extremely precious resource in the arid Southwest. The great range of
elevation nearby provides several life zones of various plants and animals to be
utilized for richer living. Ponderosa pine forests and juniper-pinyon pine woodland
both occur within 15 miles of this site.</p>
<p>The Salado enjoyed several centuries of comfortable life, with time for
production of elaborately decorated pottery and ornaments, beautifully woven
and embroidered cotton textiles, and, no doubt, development of elaborate
religious thought and ritual.</p>
<p>But at about A.D. 1200, times changed and life became more difficult.
Perhaps the population outgrew its resources. Perhaps disease spread. Perhaps
some outside enemy pressure was felt. The reason remains unknown, but in the
early 13th century the Indians began moving their villages to high ridges and
ultimately to caves, finding defensible protected sites with good, sweeping views.</p>
<p>Unsettled conditions persisted, and finally life here, for reasons we do not
know today, became impossible. Where they went, why they left, and what
their ultimate fate was, we do not know, but by the early 1400s the Salado
people were gone from the Salt River Valley.</p>

Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
